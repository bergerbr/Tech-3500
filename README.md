Project #1 was a simple Html website that was a little about me and my life. I was able to show who I was and what I like to do for fun.
I was also able to share more about my school life and also my future goals.

During project #2 I was able to make a website for selling computers. This was the first time I was able 
to make a website a little more complicated. 

Project #3

For the final project I made a website that is help for Kean students to find computer stores that are loacl. These stores are 
for people who wants to get their things fixed with stores that have a good rating.
